# rocket-nose-cone-model
A Python simulation that models and visualizes the geometry of a parabolic rocket nose cone. The project generates both 2D cross-sections and 3D surface plots using NumPy and Matplotlib, illustrating how curvature changes with parameters like cone length, radius, and shape factor K.
